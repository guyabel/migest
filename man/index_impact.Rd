\usage{
index_impact(
  m,
  p,
  pop = "pop",
  reg = "region",
  orig = "orig",
  dest = "dest",
  flow = "flow",
  long = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A \code{matrix} or data frame of origin-destination flows. For \code{matrix} the first and second dimensions correspond to origin and destination respectively. For a data frame ensure the correct column names are passed to \code{orig}, \code{dest} and \code{flow}.}

\item{p}{A data frame or named vector for the total population. When data frame, column of populations labelled using \code{pop} and region names labelled \code{reg}.}

\item{pop}{Character string of the population column name}

\item{reg}{Character string of the region column name. Must match dimension names or values in origin and destination columns of \code{m}.}

\item{orig}{Character string of the origin column name (when \code{m} is a data frame rather than a \code{matrix})}

\item{dest}{Character string of the destination column name (when \code{m} is a data frame rather than a \code{matrix})}

\item{flow}{Character string of the flow column name (when \code{m} is a data frame rather than a \code{matrix})}

\item{long}{Logical to return a long data frame with index values all in one column}
}
\value{
A tibble with 4 summary measures where
\item{effectivness}{Migration effectiveness index (MEI) from Shryock et al. (1975). Values range between 0 and 100. High values indicate migration is an efficient mechanism of population redistribution, generating a large net migration. Conversely, low values denote that migration is closely balanced, leading to comparatively little redistribution.}
\item{anmr}{Aggregate net migration rate from Bell et. al. (2002). The population weighted version of \code{mei}.}
\item{perference}{Index of preference, given in UN DESA (1983). From Bachi (1957) and Shryock et al. (1975) - measures size of migration compared to expected flows based on unifrom migration. Can go from 0 to infinity}
\item{velocity}{Index of velocity, given in UN DESA (1983). From Bogue, Shryock, Jr. & Hoermann (1957) - measures size of migration compared to expected flows based on population size alone. Can go from 0 to infinity}
