\title{Adjust migrant stock tables to have matching place of birth totals}
\usage{
match_pob_tot(m1, m2, method = "rescale", verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m1}{Matrix of migrant stock totals at time \emph{t}. Rows in the matrix correspond to place of birth and columns to place of residence at time \emph{t}+1.}

\item{m2}{Matrix of migrant stock totals at time \emph{t}+1. Rows in the matrix correspond to place of birth and columns to place of residence at time \emph{t}+1.}

\item{method}{Character string matching either \code{rescale}, \code{rescale-adjust-zero-fb}, \code{open} or \code{open-dr}. See details.}

\item{verbose}{Logical value to indicate the print the parameter estimates at each iteration of the rescale, as used in \code{ipf2}. By default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{list} object with:
\item{m1_adj }{Matrix of adjusted \code{m1} where rows (place of births) match \code{m2_adj}.}
\item{m2_adj }{Matrix of adjusted \code{m2} where rows (place of births) match \code{m1_adj}.}
\item{in_mat }{Matrix of estimated inflows into the system.}
\item{out_mat }{Matrix of estimated outflows from the system.}
}
\description{
This function is predominantly intended to be used within the ffs routines in the migest package.

\details{
The \code{rescale} and \code{rescale-adjust-zero-fb} method ensure flow estimates closely match the net migration totals implied by the changes in population totals, births and deaths - as introduced in the Science paper. The \code{rescale-adjust-zero-fb} can adjust for rare cases when row total margins that are smaller than native born totals in countries where there are no foreign born populations (e.g. South Sudan 1990-1995).
The \code{open-dr} method allows for moves in and out of the global system - as introduced in the Demographic Research paper. The \code{open} method is a slight improvement over \code{open-dr} - the calculation of the moves and in and out using more sensible weights.
