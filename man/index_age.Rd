\usage{
index_age(
  d = NULL,
  age,
  mi,
  age_min = 5,
  age_max = 65,
  breadth = 5,
  age_col = "age",
  mi_col = "mi",
  long = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Data frame of age specific migration intensities. If used, ensure the correct column names are passed to \code{age_col} and \code{mi_col}.}

\item{age}{Numeric vector of ages. Used if `d = NULL`.}

\item{mi}{Numeric vector of migration intensities corresponding to each value of `age`. Used if `d = NULL`.}

\item{age_min}{Numeric value for minimum age for peak calculations. Taken as 5 by default.}

\item{age_max}{Numeric value for maximum age for peak calculations. Taken as 65 by default.}

\item{breadth}{Numeric value for number of age groups around peak to be used in breadth_peak measure. Defualt of `5`.}

\item{age_col}{Character string of the age column name (when \code{d} is provided)}

\item{mi_col}{Character string of the migration intensities column name (when \code{d} is provided)}

\item{long}{Logical to return a long data frame with index values all in one column}
}
\value{
A tibble with 8 summary measures where
  \item{gmr}{Gross migraproduction rate of Rogers (1975)}
  \item{peak_mi}{Peak migration intensities, from Bell et. al. (2002)}
  \item{peak_age}{Corresponding age of `peak_mi`, from Bell et. al. (2002)}
  \item{peak_breadth}{Breadth of peak, from Bell and Muhidin (2009)}
  \item{peak_share}{Percentage share of peak breadth of all migration, from Bell and Muhidin (2009)}
  \item{murc}{Maximum upward rate of change of Bernard, Bell and Charles-Edwards (2014)}
  \item{mdrc}{Maximum downward rate of change of Bernard, Bell and Charles-Edwards (2014)}
  \item{asymmetry}{Asymmetry between the `murc` and `mudc`, from Bernard, Bell and Charles-Edwards (2014)}
}
