\title{
Methods for the Indirect Estimation of Bilateral Migration
}
\description{
The migest package contains a collection of R functions for indirect methods to estimate bilateral migration flows in the presence of partial or missing data. Methods might be relevant to other categorical data situations on non-migration data, where for example, marginal totals are known and only auxiliary bilateral data is available.

The estimation methods in this package can be grouped as 1) functions for origin-destination matrices (\code{\link{cm2}} and \code{\link{ipf2}}) and 2) functions for origin-destination matrices categorized by a further set of characteristics, such as ethnicity, employment or health status (\code{\link{cm3}}, \code{\link{ipf3}} and \code{\link{ipf3_qi}}). Each of these routines are based on indirect estimation methods where marginal totals are known, and a Poisson regression (log-linear) model is assumed. 

The \code{\link{ffs_diff}}, \code{\link{ffs_rates}} and \code{\link{ffs_demo}} functions provide different methods to estimate migration bilateral flows from changes in stocks, see Abel and Cohen (2019) for a review of different methods. The demo files, \code{demo(cfplot_reg2)}, \code{demo(cfplot_reg)} and \code{demo(cfplot_nat)}, produce circular migration flow plots for migration estimates from Abel(2018) and Abel and Sander (2014), which were derived using the \code{\link{ffs_demo}} function.
