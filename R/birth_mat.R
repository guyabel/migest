#' Calculate births for each element of place of birth - place of residence stock matrix
#'
#' This function is predominantly intended to be used within the ffs routines in the migest package. 
#' @param b_por Vector of numeric values for births in each place of residence
#' @param m2 Matrix of migrant stock totals at time \emph{t}+1. Rows in the matrix correspond to place of birth and columns to place of residence at time \emph{t}+1.
#' @param non_negative Adjust birth matrix calculation to ensure all deductions from \code{m2} will result in positive population counts. On rare occasions when working with international stock data the number of births can exceed the increase in the number of native born population.
#'
#' @return Matrix of place of birth by place of residence for new-bornâ€™s
